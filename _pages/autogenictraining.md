Do you want to learn how to regulate the connection between your body
and mind?

### Participants wanted for a FREE six-week autogenic training intervention
### (Beginning of April until mid of May)

Have you ever wondered whether you are able to voluntarily control autonomic processes in
your body, like lowering your heart rate or increasing your skin temperature? Would you like
to receive a free six-week training by a certified specialist that helps you achieve this, while
also providing deep relaxation to your body and mind? You can now join our study by the
Berlin School of Mind and Brain (Humboldt University)!

We are searching for motivated participants for a research project that investigates the
effects of autogenic training on individuals&#39; body and mind. Autogenic training is a
relaxation technique that has shown scientific promise in reducing stress, promoting peace
of mind, enhancing coping mechanisms, and improving emotional balance and overall well-
being. This study examines how participation in a six-week autogenic training intervention
strengthens the relationship between body and mind and affects the control of attention.
Participants Needed: We are seeking intrinsically motivated participants able to commit to
a six-week intervention starting at the beginning of April. Healthy participants with no current
physical or mental health problems. No recreational drug use throughout the study duration
(ideally, no or little alcohol consumption). Participants must be native English or German
speakers between 18 and 65 and of all genders. We will have a short Zoom interview with
candidate participants to evaluate the motivation and suitability for the study.

Study Procedure: Participants will engage in a six-week autogenic training intervention led
by a licensed and experienced teacher (Sanna von Zedlitz). The intervention will consist of
weekly in-person classes on Tuesday evenings (small group sessions), supplemented by
homework assignments for the remainder of the week (i.e., home practice of a couple of
minutes daily). Before and after the six-week training, participants will be invited to the lab for
a test session, including physiological measurements, an attentional task, and two
questionnaires. Participants will be financially compensated for their time and participation in
these two sessions (10 EUR/hour). An additional financial bonus will be provided when
logging all daily home training sessions correctly in a diary.

Benefits: You will learn and practice how to use autogenic training on your own, which has
been shown to reduce stress and improve emotional balance and overall well-being. Your
participation will advance scientific understanding of autogenic training and the mind-body
connection. You will be financially compensated for the in-lab testing session and diary
tasks.

Thank you for your interest in participating!
