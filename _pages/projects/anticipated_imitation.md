The project investigates behavioral effects of anticipated imitation in group contexts. In a line of online experiments, we assess how imitative responses by one vs. multiple agent(s) affect people’s response performance in tasks performed either alone or together with other co-actors. The project seeks to understand how people represent own and others’ actions during social interactions involving multiple interaction partners and tries to advance our understanding of the mental representations and cognitive mechanisms supporting joint action.
