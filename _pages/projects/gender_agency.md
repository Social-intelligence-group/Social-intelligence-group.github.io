For the Gender and Perceived Agency project, we aim to address the following question: How does gender influence the sense and perception of low-level agency? To do so, we will run a series of online and off-line experiments using novel methods inspired by the intentional binding paradigm, to both measure low-level agency and manipulate gender in a linear manner.
