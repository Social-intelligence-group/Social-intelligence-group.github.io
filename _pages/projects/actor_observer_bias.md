For four different vignette scenarios, each describing morally relevant interpersonal actions, we compare causal inferences and responsibility attributions in the context of the Actor Observer Bias. We want to explore if participants judge the reasons and responsibilities for their own actions differently than other persons´ actions and whether this effect depends on the participants´ Free Will Beliefs.
