For the past 15 years, there has already been quite some research within social and cognitive psychology experimentally inducing disbelief in free will and assessing its impact on behavior and cognition. In these studies, a text or video based manipulation was used, claiming that free will does not exist. More recently, a number of replication studies using these classical free will belief manipulations have failed to find an impact on downstream processes. Therefore, in this project, we would like to tap into a more immersive manipulation of these beliefs, creating a Virtual Reality experience where participants question the sense of agency they have over their actions, and see what impact this could have on their subjective belief in free will.
