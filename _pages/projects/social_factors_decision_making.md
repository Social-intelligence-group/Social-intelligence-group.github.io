In this study, we explored the influence of social factors within 3d environments on decision-making processes. Participants engaged in a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) task, where they were required to make decisions about visual stimuli. Alongside the participants, some virtual agents (avatars) also made the same decisions. Our primary focus was to investigate how the size and density of the group of virtual agent impacts the participants' choices. The findings reveal significant insights into social conformity and decision-making in VR, highlighting how larger and denser groups of virtual agents can sway individual decisions.
