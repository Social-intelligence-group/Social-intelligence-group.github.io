Measure of intention is one of the necessary elements in studies about intentional action. Previous studies have suggested that self-reported measures of intention can be manipulated after the action has been performed. In order to achieve a better measure in intention, we are now establishing the implicit measure of intention via biological markers, such as neural signal and pupil dilation.
