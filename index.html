<h2>In memory of our friend and colleague</h2>
<p>On July 17, we lost our colleague and friend Matilde Rocca. Matilde had an uncompromising dedication to science and was deeply concerned about the well being of others. Her sudden death will leave a painful gap in our team. We stand in grief with her family and friends.</p>
