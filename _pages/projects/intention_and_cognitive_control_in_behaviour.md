Our research on <strong>intentional and cognitive control of behavior</strong> tries to understand to what degree humans can freely decide what they do and how they can flexibly adapt their behavior to changing environmental demands. Here we follow two research lines:
 
<strong>Human volition and intentional control of behavior</strong>
Our research on intentional control of behavior investigates how humans can freely decide what they do, when they do it and whether they do it. Furthermore, we try to understand to what degree such free decisions can be predicted from brain signals that precede such intentional decisions.
 
<strong>Flexible control of behavior</strong>
Our research on the flexible control of behavior investigates how humans can coordinate different tasks and flexibly alternate between them. In particular, we try to understand how people represent different tasks depending on the specific control requirements.
