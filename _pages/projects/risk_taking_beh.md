In this study, we explored the dynamics of decision-making and risk-taking within social contexts and how everyday decisions, often laden with potential negative outcomes, are influenced not only by individual judgment but significantly by the surrounding social environment. By observing how individuals in a group adapt their decisions based on othersâ€™ actions and outcomes, we aim to understand the balancing act between individual decision-making and group conformity. This research explores decision-making in a constantly changing social environment, offering new insights into how group dynamics can lead to either more risk-taking or conservative behaviors.
