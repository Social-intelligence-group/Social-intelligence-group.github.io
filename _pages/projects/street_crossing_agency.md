In this project, we investigate how pedestrians' sense of agency varies in different traffic scenarios. We employ a video-based manipulation where participants can choose to either comply with traffic rules or engage in rule-breaking behavior. In each scenario, we manipulate the number of people crossing the street and examine its impact on participants' judgment of control over their avatars. Through this study, we aim to provide a better understanding of the cognitive processes underlying agency in rule compliance and collective rule-breaking contexts.
