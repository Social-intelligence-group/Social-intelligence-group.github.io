    title: Principal Investigator
    excerpt: "I am a social- and cognitive neuroscientist from Germany but spent most of my scientific career in Belgium. I am Einstein Professor for ‘Social Intelligence’ at the Berlin School of Mind and Brain and the Department of Psychology at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. Furthermore, I am PI in the excellence cluster ‘Science of Intelligence’. After my PhD at the Max Planck Institute for Psychological Research in Munich, I worked six years at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig where I was also awarded a Heisenberg fellowship from the German Research Foundation (DFG). In 2006, I received a research professorship at Ghent University where I worked until I was awarded an Einstein Strategic Professorship in 2020. I am interested in the neuro-cognitive mechanisms underlying our social behaviour and group influence. Furthermore, I want to understand how people intentionally control their thoughts and actions. Finally, I am investigating the influence of high-level beliefs on basic cognitive processes."

    title: Lab Manager
    excerpt: "My name is Jurena Wille, I have a graduate degree in psychology with a focus on cognitive neuroscience and legal psychology. In my master's thesis I investigated the influence of conceptual and visual features on memory performance for visual scenes. Currently I am a student in the master's program of the Berlin School of Mind and Brain and work as a lab manager in the Social Intelligence lab. My main research interests lie in conformity behavior, perceptions of morality and responsibility attributions. In my current project under the supervision of Prof. Marcel Brass and Dr. Carl Michael Galang, I connect Free Will Beliefs and moral responsibility attributions to Actor / Observer differences."

    title: Postdoctoral Research Fellow
    excerpt: "In daily life, we rarely question who controls our movements—until something goes wrong. Imagine scrolling on your computer when suddenly your mouse malfunctions. You’re still moving, but the cursor no longer responds. This disruption highlights a loss of *sense of agency*—the feeling of control over our movements and their outcomes. This phenomenon isn’t just a technical glitch; it’s also altered in many neurological (e.g., Apraxia, Anosognosia, and Cerebral Palsy) and psychiatric conditions (e.g., Schizophrenia). But what exactly defines our sense of agency—our movements or their consequences? And are they the same? As a postdoctoral researcher in the lab, I will explore these questions using precise, unbiased experimental measures."

    title: Postdoctoral Research Fellow
    excerpt: "My name is Asieh Daneshi and I come from Iran. I am currently a Post-Doc researcher in Marcel’s lab. My bachelor and master studies were on electrical engineering and my PhD was on biomedical engineering (bioelectric). For my PhD, I worked on computational models of decision-making during driving (based on attention). I conducted my experiments in virtual reality environment. I have also experience in recording and analyzing eye motion, EEG, and fMRI data. I am interested to study how does the decision-making process take place in our brains, especially in dynamic environments. The title of my current project in Marcel’s lab is “Experimental investigation of behavioral contagion in VR”. We are studying how decisions of each person can affect the decisions of other persons around him/her."

    title: Postdoctoral Research Fellow
    excerpt: "I am a social and cognitive neuroscientist, theater artist, storyteller, and social activist. I was born, educated, and created theater in Israel, and I am presently a postdoc in the lab. I graduated with highest honors from Tel-Aviv University in Theatre Art and Linguistics under the supervision of Prof. Nurit Yaari. My PhD in the in experimental Social Cognitive Neuroscience was obtained at Ben-Gurion University under the supervision of Prof. Avishi Henik. I collaborated with Prof. Simon Samay-Tzoory from Haifa University on interbrain synchronization, group dynamics, and perspective taking. I also have expertise in pupil dilation and fNIRS methods. My major area of research is imagination and its significance in our emotional, cognitive, and social lives. In Berlin, I collaborate with Prof. Marcel Brass to develop a new approach for researching high-level beliefs utilizing narratives and virtual reality methods.

I completed my master's degree in Neural and Behavioral Biology at the Georg August University of Göttingen. My research interests focus on learning and memory processes and their development. My PhD project examines the neural and computational mechanisms underlying experiential (individual) and observational learning and their effect on memory formation. To investigate whether experiential and observational learning differ in memory encoding, I am applying a neurocomputational approach combining neural (EEG) and behavioral measures with computational modeling. Additionally, I am interested in exploring potential developmental differences in these processes between children and young adults."
