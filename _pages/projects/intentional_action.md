Traditional interpretation of the results in the Libet-style experiments has challenged the existence of free will. Responding to this challenge, there are recent decision models suggesting alternative interpretations to those results. The current project aims at testing the validity of these models with the integration of behavioral and neuroimaging approaches. By validating these models, it would enrich our understanding to the psychological and neural mechanism behind volition, as well as providing hints to resolve the debate about free will in cognitive neuroscience and philosophy.
