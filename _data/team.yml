    title: Principal Investigator
    excerpt: "I am a social- and cognitive neuroscientist from Germany but spent most of my scientific career in Belgium. I am Einstein Professor for ‘Social Intelligence’ at the Berlin School of Mind and Brain and the Department of Psychology at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. Furthermore, I am PI in the excellence cluster ‘Science of Intelligence’. After my PhD at the Max Planck Institute for Psychological Research in Munich, I worked six years at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig where I was also awarded a Heisenberg fellowship from the German Research Foundation (DFG). In 2006, I received a research professorship at Ghent University where I worked until I was awarded an Einstein Strategic Professorship in 2020. I am interested in the neuro-cognitive mechanisms underlying our social behaviour and group influence. Furthermore, I want to understand how people intentionally control their thoughts and actions. Finally, I am investigating the influence of high-level beliefs on basic cognitive processes."

    excerpt: "I am a cognitive neuroscientist at Ghent University, currently working as a guest researcher at the Social Intelligence Lab. I did my PhD at the Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience in Berlin, and then did a postdoc at the Department of Experimental Psychology, Ghent University.<br><br>My research focuses on the neural basis of cognitive control and intentional action, how task-relevant information is represented in the brain, and how such representations change under varying demands. To investigate these issues, I combine functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), machine learning tools such as multivariate decoding and representational similarity analysis, and computational modelling techniques.<br><br>I also have a keen interest in laypeople’s views on free will (“Do you think free will exists?”), whether (dis)believing in free will affects our behavior, and how beliefs and attitudes towards free will are related."

    title: Postdoctoral Research Fellow
    excerpt: "My name is Matilde Rocca, and I am a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at the Social Intelligence Lab. I did my PhD in Neuroscience at the University of Turin, within the Cognition, Motion and Neuroscience Lab led by Prof. Cristina Becchio, under the supervision of Prof. Andrea Cavallo. I performed all my research activity at the Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, based in Genoa, Italy. My PhD project focused on studying how we represent other people's actions when we actively engage in a social interaction with them. To do this, I studied detailed aspects of upper-limb movement kinematics during real-time dyadic joint actions. Within the Social Intelligence Lab, I aim to investigate how we represent the actions performed by multiple agents simultaneously, and how these representations affect our own motor behaviour, in order to address issues related to social group conformity from a motor perspective."

    title: PhD Student
    excerpt: "My name is Mathias Van der Biest, and I am a PhD student from Belgium. During my master thesis (Ghent University), I investigated how making a choice affects our preference for arbitrary tasks (promotor: Prof. Dr. Marcel Brass and Dr. David Wisniewski). Moreover, I joined the Sampendu lab (University of Auckland, Prof. Dr. Sam Schwarzkopf) for a six-month research internship, where I investigated the interplay between cognition and visual perception in virtual reality environments. Following my masters, I started with a PhD in the lab of Prof. Marcel Brass and in 2021 I was awarded the FWO aspirant fundamental research grant. In my PhD project, I investigate how key social attributes (e.g. trustworthiness, social status) of the instructor modulate how we process novel instructions (e.g. sensory processing, encoding, preparation, implementation)."

I attempt to recreate aspects of the social world in VR environments as I am intrigued by the confluence between cognitive neuroscience and anthropology. I completed my postgraduate studies at the University of Oxford and previously received training in cognitive science from Indian Institute of Technology (IITGN) at the Control and Learning of Action Lab. I have a keen interest in embodied cognition, two-person neuroscience and group conformity."

I am currently a Ph.D student at the Berlin School of Mind and Brain and Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Marcel Brass and Prof. Dr. Michael Pauen. My research topic is about manipulating laypeople’s subjective belief in free will through immersive Virtual Reality experiences. I investigate whether adding an experience to the method of manipulation could have an impact on down-stream processes (e.g. behavior, cognitive process), which was not the case for previous methods in literature. Further, my research interests include various topics such as: social facilitation, Theory of Mind, and cultural differences in beliefs."

I completed my masters degree in Neural and Behavioral Biology at the Georg August University of Göttingen. My PhD research topic is the neural mechanisms underlying experiential and observational learning and how they affect memory formation. I take a neural (EEG), behavioral and computational modelling approach to study whether both learning types differ in their effect on memory encoding and to check for possible age-dependent differences during human development."

I am currently working as a research assistant at the Social Intelligence Lab, investigating the contribution of auditory and visual cues to group contagion in a Virtual Reality environment. Previously, I have investigated the tonotopy and periodotopy of the primary auditory cortex using fMRI. My research interests tend to center around social cognition and evolutionary psychology/neuroscience, with a special interest in group-related processes and the role of attention and memory in social cognition."

I studied Clinical Psychology in Moscow as my first degree, and currently I am pursuing my master’s degree in Cognitive Neuroscience at HU Berlin. For my thesis in Moscow, I applied natural language processing and data analysis in the field of psychotherapy research. At the same time, I worked as a research assistant to Tommaso Fedele in the Institute for Cognitive Neuroscience at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow. We analyzed MEG recordings of epileptic patients using machine learning algorithms to reveal seizure initialization and propagation. In Berlin, I decided to switch my research to social and cognitive psychology. Since April 2020, I have been working in the Social Intelligence group at HU Berlin, where I have been developing behavioral experiments online and in virtual reality."
