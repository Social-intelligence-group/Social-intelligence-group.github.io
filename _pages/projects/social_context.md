The research group 'Social Intelligence' investigates the social cognitive mechanisms underlying our ability to successfully navigate our social environment.

We investigate social intelligence on three different levels:

* The sensorimotor level: How do social agents interact on an embodied level? This involves phenomena such as social imitation.
* The symbolic level: How does symbolic communication and mental state attribution contribute to social intelligence?
* The cultural level: How does our cultural environment and high-level beliefs contribute to social intelligence?
